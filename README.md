Demo: https://fez994.github.io/Twitch.tv-JSON-API-/



This project is part of the freecodecamp Intermediate Front End Development Project





(https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api)











- User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

- User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

- User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

- User Story: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.


(I don't really like the idea of seeing a placeholder if a streamer has closed their twitch account, so i'll comment out the code,
if you would like to see if it works, just remove the comments and add "comster404" to the array of streamers)
